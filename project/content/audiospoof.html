            <h3>What is Deepfake?</h3>
            <p>Audio spoofing, also known as voice spoofing, is a technique where synthetic or altered audio is used
                to mimic a person's voice.:</p>
            <h3>Techniques</h3>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Voice Cloning</b>: This involves creating a digital model of a person's voice 
                            using recordings. Once the model is created, it can generate new speech that sounds 
                            like the original speaker, even saying things they never actually said.</li>
                        <li><b>Speech Synthesis</b>: This technology converts text into spoken words using a 
                            synthesized voice. When combined with voice cloning, it can produce speech that 
                            sounds indistinguishable from the real person.</li>
                        <li><b>Manipulation of Recorded Audio</b>: This involves editing or altering existing 
                            audio recordings to change the content or meaning of what was originally said. 
                            Techniques such as splicing, pitch adjustment, and adding background noise can 
                            be used to enhance the deception.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            <h3>How to examine fake/cloned voice?</h3>
            <ul class="styled-list"> 
                <li><b>Audio</b> — Does someone’s voice not match their appearance (ex. a heavyset man with a higher-pitched feminine voice)? Is the Voice clipping? Is there some kind of distortion in person's voice?</li>
