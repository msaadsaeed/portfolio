                <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
                <p class="description">Artificial Intelligence, commonly referred to as AI, is the field of computer science dedicated to creating 
                    systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include learning from 
                    experience, recognizing patterns, understanding natural language, and making decisions. AI aims to replicate 
                    or simulate human cognitive processes in machines, enabling them to function autonomously and intelligently. 
                    AI is already a part of our daily lives. Here are some common examples:<p>
                    <h4 class="type-head">Voice Assistants:</h4>
                    <p class="description">Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use AI to understand and answer your questions.</p>
                    <h4 class="type-head">Streaming Services:</h4>
                    <p class="description">Netflix and Spotify use AI to recommend movies, shows, and music based on what you’ve watched or listened to before.</p>
                    <h4 class="type-head">Online Shopping:</h4>
                    <p class="description">Amazon uses AI to suggest products you might like based on your browsing and purchase history.</p>

                <h2>Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
                <p class="description">Machine Learning is a subcategory of AI. It focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models 
                    that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being 
                    explicitly programmed to perform a task, ML systems are trained using large amounts of data to recognize 
                    patterns and improve their performance over time. Typically these steps are involved for making a Machine Learning system:</p>
                    <h4 class="type-head">Learning from Data:</h4>
                    <p class="description">Machine learning involves feeding a computer lots of data. For example, if you 
                        want a computer to recognize pictures of cats and dogs, you would give it thousands of pictures of 
                        cats and dogs.</p>
                    <h4 class="type-head">Finding Patterns:</h4>
                    <p class="description">The computer looks at all this data and starts to recognize patterns. It learns what
                         makes a cat look like a cat and a dog look like a dog.</p>
                    <h4 class="type-head">Making Predictions:</h4>
                    <p class="description">Once the computer has learned these patterns, it can then look at new pictures 
                        and decide whether they are of cats or dogs.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="content3" class="content-section" style="display: none;">
                <h2>Deep Learning (DL)</h2>
                <p class="description">Deep Learning is a specialized subcategory of machine learning. It involves neural networks with many 
                    'layers (hence the term "deep") that can model complex patterns in large amounts of data. Deep learning
                     has revolutionized fields such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous 
                     driving. The structure of deep learning models is inspired by the human brain, enabling these systems to 
                     learn and make decisions with high accuracy. These steps are involved for making a Deep Learning System:</p>
                    <h4 class="type-head">Neural Networks:</h4>
                    <p class="description">Deep learning uses artificial neural networks, which are made up of layers of nodes. 
                        Each node is like a neuron in the human brain, processing a small piece of information.</p>
                    <h4 class="type-head">Layers of Learning:</h4>
                    <p class="description">These networks have many layers (hence "deep" learning). Information passes 
                        through these layers, with each layer learning to recognize different features. For example, in 
                        an image of a cat, the first layer might recognize edges, the next layer might recognize shapes, 
                        and deeper layers might recognize parts of the cat like eyes or fur.</p>
                    <h4 class="type-head">Training with Data:</h4>
                    <p class="description">The neural network is trained using a large amount of data. 
                        It adjusts the connections between nodes based on the data it processes, learning 
                        to make better decisions over time. For instance, it can learn to recognize objects 
                        in images or understand spoken language.</p>

                <h2>Generative AI</h2>
                <p class="description">Generative AI is a subcategory of deep learning that focuses on creating new content. This includes generating 
                    images, text, music, and even videos that are indistinguishable from content created by humans. Technologies 
                    like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformers (e.g., GPT-3) are at the forefront of generative 
                    AI. These models can produce realistic images, write coherent articles, compose music, and much more, opening 
                    up new possibilities in creative industries and beyond. The Generative AI works by:</p>
                    <h4 class="type-head">Learning from Examples:</h4>
                        <p class="description">Generative AI models are trained on large datasets containing many examples of 
                        what they need to create. For instance, a model trained to generate artwork would learn from thousands
                            of paintings.</p>
                    <h4 class="type-head">Generating New Content:</h4>
                        <p class="description">Once trained, these models can generate new content by understanding the patterns and 
                        structures in the training data. For example, it can create a new piece of music that sounds like it was 
                        composed by a human.</p>
                    <p class="description" style="margin-left: 20px">Everyday examples of Generative AI include:</p>

                            prompts or styles.</p>
                    <h4 class="type-head">Text Generation:</h4>
                        <p class="description">Models like GPT can write articles, create stories, and even draft emails,

                        <p class="description">AI tools can compose new music tracks that sound like they were created by

                <p class="description"><b>Deepfake</b> is a technology that uses artificial intelligence to create realistic fake videos 
                    or images. It combines "deep learning" and "fake" to describe how it works: by using deep learning techniques,
                     it can alter or generate video and audio content that appears to be real, even though it's not.<br><b>Audio Spoofing</b> 
                     involves creating fake audio recordings that sound like someone else. Using AI, these technologies can mimic a 
                     person’s voice to say things they never actually said.
                     The deepfakes can be created by:</p>

                    <p class="description">Both technologies are trained on respective modality information of a large number of persons 
                        person. They learns to mimic their facial expressions, voice features, and movements.</p>
                <h4 class="type-head">Creating Fake Content:</h4>
                    <p class="description">Once trained, the technology can swap faces in videos, making it look like 
                        someone else is saying or doing something they never did. It can also create entirely 
                        new videos that look real with realistic audio of specific person.</p>
