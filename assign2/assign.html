      <p>This <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rprkh15/mountaineering-deaths-14-tallest-mountains">dataset</a> contains information about various incidents related to mountain climbing, 
        including date of incident, name of mountaineer, nationality of mountaineer, cause of death. The dataset is available as 14 separate .csv 
        files for the top 14 highest peaks in the world. Before plotting, I have performed these preprocessing steps on the dataset:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Selected the CSV files for the top 5 highest peaks: Mount Everest, K2, Kangchenjunga, Lhotse, and Makalu.</li>
        <li>The dataset contains lengthy descriptions of the cause of death in some cases. Therefore, I applied preprocessing to condense these descriptions into specific categories. 
          Ultimately, we classified the causes of death into 11 generic categories.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For plotting I have chosen the <b>Cause of death</b> and <b>Mountains.</b> In some plots the <b>Death Count</b> is based on <b>Cause of death</b> stratified by Mountain. 
        Whereas in others the death count is based on mountians stratified by cause of death. Therefore, the plotting gives various insights into the dataset under study.</p>

        A grouped bar chart is a type of bar chart that displays data in the form of rectangular bars with the bards grouped by categories.
        In this graph, the data has been stratified based on <b>Mountain</b> (x-axis) and <b>Death Count</b> (y-axis) is based on <b>Cause of death</b>. This graphs
        gives clear insights for comparison across <b>Mountain</b> categorires. For example, we can see that Mount Everest has the most deaths due to <b>Avalanche</b> and <b>Fall</b>
        in comparison to other <b>Mountains</b>. Moreover, it is also evident that <b>Fall</b> is prominent <b>Cause of death</b> across all categories. We can also see the individual 
        <b>Death Count</b> due to specific cause across all <b>Mountains.</b>

        The heatmap effectively represents data density by using color gradients to show the distribution.
        The heatmap shows the <b>Death Count</b> by <b>Cause of death</b> and <b>Mountain</b>, with color intensity representing the count. 
        The major aspect that is hard to determine in other types of plots, heatmaps can provide insights into potential correlations. 
        For instance, if certain <b>Cause of death</b> often occur together on the same <b>Mountain</b> but not on others, 
        it may indicate a correlation between those causes specific to that <b>Mountain</b>. For instance, <b>Mount Everest</b> has the most
        <b>Death Counts</b> due to <b>Avalanches</b> followed by <b>Fall</b> and <b>Exposure</b>. Similarly, <b>K2</b> has most deaths due to <b>Fall.</b>
        Such correlation is most easy to most obvious in these kind of plots.

        This heatmap applies <b>Logarithmic Scaling (base 10)</b> to the <b>Death Count</b>, providing a different perspective on the data. 
        Log scaled plots offer several benefits, especially when dealing with data that spans dealing that wide range of values.
        As it is clear from this plot that logarithmic scaling makes <b>small changes</b> in data more obvious, especially in the lower range of values.
        Log scaling is useful where most values are concentrated in a narrow range, but there are a few extreme values. In comparison to simple heat map plot,
        the log scaling has given highlighted patterns and trends that were not apparent in previous scale. For example, the previous analysis of
        <b>Mount Everest</b> has become more obvious. Also, we only saw the most common <b>Cause of death</b> for <b>K2</b> is <b>Fall</b>. Here it has become
        clear the second <b>Cause of death</b> are <b>Storm</b> and <b>Avalanches.</b>. This was not obvious in linear heatmap plot. Some enhanced features for 
        other <b>Mountains</b> and <b>Cause of death</b> have become more obvious now.

      <div class="plot-description">
        In conclusion we have seen how different types of plots, such as <b>grouped bar charts</b>, <b>stacked bar charts</b>, <b>bubble charts</b>, 
        <b>heatmaps</b>, and <b>log scaled plots</b>, allow for the identification of various patterns and trends in the data. Each plot has its own strength for 
        different type of message. Some charts provide an insight into relationship between <b>Death Counts</b> while others provide a correlation between
        the features under study. For instance, log scaled plots, can highlight the distribution of death counts across different 
        <b>Causes of death</b> and <b>Mountains</b>, indicating where the data is concentrated.
